# Welcome to the GitHub profile of a talented React Native Developer!

With over 2 years of experience building Android and iOS applications using React Native, you can be sure that your projects are in good hands. As a skilled developer, I have a deep understanding of the React Native framework, allowing me to build powerful and efficient applications that meet the specific needs of my clients.

One of my recent contributions to the Open Source community includes my addition to **React Native Reanimated**.

As a contributor to this project, I am proud to have played a part in advancing the capabilities of the React Native ecosystem.

When working with me, you can expect clear communication, timely delivery of projects, and a strong commitment to quality. I am passionate about creating elegant and intuitive applications that meet the needs of my clients and their users.
